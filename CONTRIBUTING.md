- Clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, cluster version, etc.)
- Relevant logs or screenshots

### 💡 Suggest Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:

- Check if the feature has already been suggested
- Provide a clear use case and rationale
- Consider implementation approaches
- Be open to discussion and feedback

### 📝 Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always appreciated:

- Fix typos or clarify unclear sections
- Add examples or tutorials
- Document undocumented features
- Improve error messages

### 💻 Submit Code Changes

Code contributions should:

- Follow our code standards (see below)
- Include tests where applicable
- Update documentation as needed
- Pass all CI/CD checks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- Go 1.24+ (for backend/operator development)
- Node.js 20+ and npm (for frontend development)
- Python 3.11+ (for runner development)
- Podman or Docker (for building containers)
- Minikube and kubectl (for local development)
- Git for version control

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vTeam.git
   cd vTeam
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ambient-code/vTeam.git
   ```

### Install Git Hooks (Recommended)

To prevent accidental commits to protected branches (`main`, `master`, `production`), install our git hooks:

```bash
make setup-hooks
```

Or run the installation script directly:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

**What the hooks do:**

- **pre-commit** - Blocks commits to `main`/`master`/`production` branches
- **pre-push** - Blocks pushes to `main`/`master`/`production` branches

**Hooks are automatically installed** when you run `make dev-start`.

If you need to override the hooks (e.g., for hotfixes):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "hotfix: critical fix"
git push --no-verify origin main
```

See [scripts/git-hooks/README.md](scripts/git-hooks/README.md) for more details.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always work on a feature branch, not `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code patterns and style
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Test your changes locally

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add multi-repo session support"
git commit -m "fix: resolve PVC mounting issue in minikube"
git commit -m "docs: update minikube setup instructions"
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for operator"
```

Commit message prefixes:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Code Standards

### Go Code (Backend & Operator)

**Formatting:**
```bash
# Auto-format your code
gofmt -w components/backend components/operator
```

**Quality Checks:**
```bash
# Backend
cd components/backend
gofmt -l .                    # Check formatting (should output nothing)
go vet ./...                  # Detect suspicious constructs
golangci-lint run            # Run comprehensive linting

# Operator
cd components/operator
gofmt -l .
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run
```

**Install golangci-lint:**
```bash
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use explicit error handling, never `panic()` in production code
- Always use user-scoped Kubernetes clients for API operations
- Implement proper RBAC checks before resource access
- Never log sensitive data (tokens, API keys)
- Use `unstructured.Nested*` helpers for type-safe CR access
- Set OwnerReferences on child resources for automatic cleanup

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive backend/operator development standards.

### Frontend Code (NextJS)

```bash
cd components/frontend
npm run lint                  # ESLint checks
npm run build                 # Ensure builds without errors/warnings
```

**Best Practices:**

- Zero `any` types (use proper TypeScript types)
- Use Shadcn UI components only (no custom UI from scratch)
- Use React Query for ALL data operations (no manual `fetch()`)
- Use `type` over `interface`
- Colocate single-use components with their pages
- All buttons must show loading states
- All lists must have empty states
- All nested pages must have breadcrumbs

See [components/frontend/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md](components/frontend/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) for complete frontend standards.

### Python Code (Runners)

```bash
cd components/runners/claude-code-runner

# Format code
black .
isort .

# Lint
flake8
```

**Standards:**

- Use `black` formatting (88 char line length)
- Use `isort` for import sorting
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Add type hints where appropriate

## Testing Requirements

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd components/backend
make test              # All tests
make test-unit         # Unit tests only
make test-contract     # Contract tests only
make test-integration  # Integration tests (requires k8s cluster)
make test-coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Operator Tests

```bash
cd components/operator
go test ./... -v
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd components/frontend
npm test
```

**Testing Guidelines:**

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure tests pass locally before pushing
- Aim for meaningful test coverage
- Write clear test descriptions
- Use table-driven tests in Go

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Run all quality checks** for the components you modified
2. **Run tests** and ensure they pass
3. **Update documentation** if you changed functionality
4. **Rebase on latest main** to avoid merge conflicts
5. **Test locally** with Minikube if possible

### PR Description

Your PR should include:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Description** of what changed and why
- **Related issues** (use "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #123")
- **Testing performed** - how you verified the changes
- **Screenshots** (if UI changes)
- **Breaking changes** (if any)

### Review Process

- All PRs require at least one approval
- GitHub Actions will automatically run:
  - Go linting checks (gofmt, go vet, golangci-lint)
  - Component builds
  - Tests
- Address review feedback promptly
- Keep discussions focused and professional
- Be open to suggestions and alternative approaches

### After Approval

- Squash commits will happen automatically on merge
- Your PR will be merged to `main`
- Delete your feature branch after merge

## Local Development Setup

The recommended way to develop and test Ambient Code Platform locally is using **Minikube**. This provides a lightweight Kubernetes environment on your local machine with no authentication requirements, making development fast and easy.

### Installing Minikube and Prerequisites

#### macOS

```bash
# Install using Homebrew
brew install minikube kubectl
```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
# Install Podman
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install podman

# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Install Minikube
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

#### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
# Install Podman
sudo dnf install podman

# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

# Install Minikube
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

### Quick Start

Once Minikube and prerequisites are installed, you can start the complete development environment with a single command:

#### First-Time Setup

```shell
make local-up
```

This command will:
- Start Minikube with appropriate resources
- Enable required addons (ingress, storage)
- Build container images
- Deploy all components (backend, frontend, operator)
- Set up networking

The setup takes 2-3 minutes on first run.

#### Access the Application

Get the access URL:

```shell
make local-url
```

This will display the frontend and backend URLs, typically:
- Frontend: `http://192.168.64.4:30030`
- Backend: `http://192.168.64.4:30080`

Or manually construct the URL:

```shell
# Get Minikube IP
minikube ip

# Access at http://<minikube-ip>:30030
```

**Authentication:**

Authentication is **completely disabled** for local development:
- ✅ No login required
- ✅ Automatic login as "developer"
- ✅ Full access to all features
- ✅ Backend uses service account for Kubernetes API

#### Stopping and Restarting

Stop the application (keeps Minikube running):

```shell
make local-stop
```

Restart the application:

```shell
make local-up
```

Delete the entire Minikube cluster:

```shell
make local-delete
```

### Additional Development Commands

**Check status:**
```bash
make local-status       # View pod status and deployment info
```

**View logs:**
```bash
make local-logs         # Backend logs
make local-logs-frontend # Frontend logs (if available)
make local-logs-operator # Operator logs (if available)
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
make local-stop         # Stop deployment, keep Minikube running
make local-delete       # Delete entire Minikube cluster
```

**Access Kubernetes:**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ambient-code       # View pods
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n ambient-code # View specific pod logs
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n ambient-code # Debug pod issues
```

## Troubleshooting

### Minikube Installation and Setup Issues

#### Insufficient Resources

If Minikube or the platform won't start, you may need to allocate more resources:

```shell
# Stop Minikube
minikube stop

# Delete the existing cluster
minikube delete

# Start with more resources
minikube start --memory=8192 --cpus=4 --disk-size=50g

# Then deploy the application
make local-up
```

#### Minikube Won't Start

If Minikube fails to start, try these steps:

```shell
# Check status
minikube status

# View logs
minikube logs

# Try with a specific driver
minikube start --driver=podman
# or
minikube start --driver=docker
```

#### Complete Minikube Reset

If Minikube is completely broken, you can fully reset it:

```shell
# Stop and delete cluster
minikube stop
minikube delete

# Clear cache (optional)
rm -rf ~/.minikube/cache

# Start fresh
minikube start --memory=4096 --cpus=2
make local-up
```

### Application Issues

#### Viewing Logs via CLI

The fastest way to view logs:

```bash
make local-logs         # Backend logs
kubectl logs -n ambient-code -l app=backend --tail=100 -f
kubectl logs -n ambient-code -l app=frontend --tail=100 -f
kubectl logs -n ambient-code -l app=operator --tail=100 -f
```

#### Viewing Logs via Kubernetes Dashboard

For detailed debugging through the Kubernetes dashboard:

```bash
# Open Kubernetes dashboard
minikube dashboard
```

This will open a web interface where you can:
1. Navigate to **Workloads > Pods**
2. Select the `ambient-code` namespace
3. Click on a pod to view details and logs

#### Common Issues

**Pods not starting:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ambient-code
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n ambient-code
```

**Image pull errors:**

```bash
kubectl get events -n ambient-code --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

**Check if images are loaded:**

```bash
minikube ssh docker images | grep ambient-code
```

**PVC issues:**

```bash
kubectl get pvc -n ambient-code
kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name> -n ambient-code
```

**Service not accessible:**

```bash
# Check services
kubectl get services -n ambient-code

# Check NodePort assignments
kubectl get service backend -n ambient-code -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'
kubectl get service frontend -n ambient-code -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}'

# Get Minikube IP
minikube ip
```

**Networking issues:**

```bash
# Verify ingress addon is enabled
minikube addons list | grep ingress

# Enable if disabled
minikube addons enable ingress
```
