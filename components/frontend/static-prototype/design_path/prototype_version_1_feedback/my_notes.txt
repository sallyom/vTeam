Feedback on Version 1 of the Ambient Code prototype

Actionable

- Hide workflows from the project view
- Hide API keys from the project view for now until we have Jira integration
- Move Project info to overview page
- Each step in a workflow depends on the successful completion of the step before it. For example if the /spec command needs /ideate to have successfully run. A successful run of a step is determined by weather or not it generated an artifact. For example if there is no rfe.md generated then /spec is disabled.
- The workflow descriptions in each step should change to status messages when the step is running. For example when a user runs /ideate then ‘Create or update rfe.md file’ should become ‘Generating rfe.md’

Needs further discussion

- Open question: File editing the ambient code UI, do we need it for MVP?
- Open question: Can we abstract the idea of a spec repo for artifacts and config or can we have a default storage area on the container we are running in?
- Open question: Collaboration
